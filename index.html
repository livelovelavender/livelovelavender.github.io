		<p id = Content>Today we took a fantastic trip to San Francisco! We saw a real SF flat today,
		I don't think I could move to the big city. We got lunch at Scoma's in Sausalito, where I tried oysters
		and alex tried clams for the first time! The restraunt was on the water with a beautiful view and delicious food.
		I ordered a cioppino wich was absolutely amazing. I have a picture on my out of 10 section,
		the bowl was bigger than my head! The weather was great, it was raining (my favorite) and we took the ferry, passing by Alcatraz island.
		[did the escapees live??? i think not] Tons of fun, 10/10 would recommend.</p>

		<p id = RatingContent>This was called the "Lazy Cioppino" which had mussels, clams, crab, prawn, and cod.
			It was unbelievably delicious. Whenever I see cioppino on the menu, I think of when I had it in Victoria, Canada
			overlooking the water. I will dream about that dish forever and ever. My rule of thumb is to never order seafood
			unless you can see the water where it came from. Who has business selling seafood in the middle of nowhere?
			Don't trust it. I'm scared of getting food poisoning. Luckily, Scoma's is so fresh and so tasty. I loved it,
			it was a great treat. I give -1 point because I only got 2 mussels and mussels are my favorite shellfish.

		<p id="Content">Alex and I spent the entire 
			evening in Beverly Hills exploring and causing mayhem. 
			Stopped by Polo Ralph Lauren on Rodeo drive to drop a few
			thousand on a new wallet (not). Then we had dinner at this really
			nice family owned italian place called Il Pastaio. 
			I had an interesting mashup of sausage, noodles and spinach,
			with an interesting butter garlic sauce. Boyfriend had a bowl of creamy 
			pumpkin tortellini. We thought it would be fun to try Cheesecake
			from THE Cheesecake Factory but we got gnarly stomach aches. 0/10 do not recommend.
			However, I DO recommend walking The Grove during the holiday season, they decorate it
			really nice and sometimes it even snows. I went into the 3 story Barnes & Noble for
			the first time also, it quite the sight to be seen.

		<p id = Content>We went to the beach! Spent all morning
			at the malibu country mart- which was fun because it was so gloomy
			and rainy. Kinda weird to see such a luxurious place so
			down in the dumps and dreary. We had lunch at Dukes- which honestly was
			a huge dissapointment but thats okay.
