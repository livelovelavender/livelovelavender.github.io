			<p id=Content>The first book I read in 2025 was "Seven Days in June" by Tia Williams.
				A good love story between 2 authors. #2 was "Wait for It" by Mariana Zapata. A slow burn romance,
				written by the queen of slow burn herself. For books 3 through 5, I read the Empyrean series, my
				second time reading Fourth Wing and Iron Flame. I'll probably read it again whenever the 4th book
				comes out. Onyx
				Storm had me in a chokehold. I couldn't put it down and the ending was INSANE. 5 stars series for
				me.
				Now I'm reading "All Rhodes Lead Here" by Mariana Zapata (another slow burn). It's about Ora and
				Rhodes, Ora is
				on a journey to start a new life and Rhodes needs to be less broody. I can't wait for them to fall
				in love.

			<p id=Content>That's a wrap for Christmas 2024. I'm so incredibly grateful for my family
				and everything they do for me. Lots of love going around during the holidays, it makes
				my heart so warm. I got to see all my cousins and play fun games to win cool prizes. Super
				fun-filled times.
				I also got a kindle paperwhite for Christmas!!! I've been telling
				alex I want one for the past year. If you see me, I'll be reading.</p>

			<p id=Content>Today we took a fantastic trip to San Francisco! We saw a real SF flat today,
				I don't think I could move to the big city. We got lunch at Scoma's in Sausalito, where I tried
				oysters
				and alex tried clams for the first time! The restraunt was on the water with a beautiful view and
				delicious food.
				I ordered a cioppino wich was absolutely amazing. I have a picture on my out of 10 section,
				the bowl was bigger than my head! The weather was great, it was raining (my favorite) and we took
				the ferry, passing by Alcatraz island.
				[did the escapees live??? i think not] Tons of fun, 10/10 would recommend.</p>

			<p id=RatingContent>This was called the "Lazy Cioppino" which had mussels, clams, crab, prawn, calamari,
				and cod.
				It was unbelievably delicious. My rule of thumb is to never order seafood
				unless you can see a body of water.
				I give -1 point because I only got 3 mussels and they are my favorite shellfish.

			<p id="Content">Alex and I spent the entire
				evening in Beverly Hills exploring and causing mayhem.
				Stopped by Polo Ralph Lauren on Rodeo drive to drop a few
				thousand on a new wallet (not). Then we had dinner at this really
				nice family owned italian place called Il Pastaio.
				I had an interesting mashup of sausage, noodles and spinach,
				with an interesting butter garlic sauce. Boyfriend had a bowl of creamy
				pumpkin tortellini. We thought it would be fun to try Cheesecake
				from THE Cheesecake Factory but we got gnarly stomach aches. 0/10 do not recommend.
				However, I DO recommend walking The Grove during the holiday season, they decorate it
				really nice and sometimes it even "snows". I went into the 3 story Barnes & Noble for
				the first time also, it quite the sight to be seen.

			<p id=Content>We went to the beach! Spent all morning
				at the malibu country mart- which was fun because it was so gloomy
				and rainy. Kinda weird to see such a luxurious place so
				down in the dumps and dreary. We had lunch at Dukes- which honestly was
				a huge dissapointment but thats okay.We still love malibu, and cant wait to go
				back in the summer!
